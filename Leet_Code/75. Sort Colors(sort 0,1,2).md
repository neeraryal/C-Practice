Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

```c
void swap (int * a, int *b)
{
    if(a!=b)
    {
        *a = *a + *b;
        *b = *a - *b;
        *a = *a - *b;
    }
}

void sortColors(int* arr, int n) 
{
    int left=0, right=n-1, i=0;

    while ( i<= right )  
    {
        if(arr[i]== 0)
        {
            swap(arr+i,arr+left);
            left++;
            i++;
        }
        else if (arr[i]==2)
        {
            swap(arr+i,arr+right);
            right --;
        }
        else i++;
    }
}
```
