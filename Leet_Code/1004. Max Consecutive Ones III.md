Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.


```c
int longestOnes(int* arr, int n, int k) 
{
    int zero_count_in_current_window=0;

    int left=0, right=0;
    int res=0;

    while(right<n)
    {
        if(arr[right]==0) zero_count_in_current_window++;
        while(zero_count_in_current_window >k)
        {
            if(arr[left]==0) zero_count_in_current_window--;
            left++;
        }
        res=res>(right-left+1)?res:(right-left+1);
        right++;
    }
    return res;
}

```
